## Open Tech Emergency Case

![#ASkotec case front](images/readme/askotec-case-front.jpg)

[#ASKotec](https://openculture.agency/outcomes/askotec/);
the *Access to Skills and Knowledge Open Tech Emergency Case* is a resource kit for community trainers,
created for mobile field-use where there is neither easy power nor internet connectivity such as refugee camps,
low-infrastructure regions or rural areas.
Intended as [_Open Tech for Good_](https://openculture.agency/open-technology/), #ASKotec was created through a series of hub development workshops
by a community of young innovators intent on bringing skills training and peace-building together
in the effort to end the South Sudan conflict.
